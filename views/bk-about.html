      The Blue Kitchen Story
  </p>
  <p class="w3-xlarge">
    Blue Kitchen, Inc. is a non-profit founded in our own blue kitchen in the Spring of 2024.  
    We decided on this name because this is generally where we gather to create and share nourishment 
    for body and mind.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-xlarge">
    The ideas behind Blue Kitchen were spawned during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with its isolating disruption to our lives.
    During this time, we were presented with a unique opportunity to our break routines, reflect on and reevaluate how and where 
    we were spending our time and realign ourselves with our personal goals.  It also brought a staunch awareness 
    (a.k.a. a reality check) of how quickly life can change and how dependent we are upon each other and society.  
  </p>
  <p class="w3-xlarge"> 
    During this time of isolation and uncertainty, we learned to be unapologetically creative and resourceful and in this, we learned
    how to convert abiguity and uncertainty into meaningfulness and opportunity.
  </p>  
  <p class="w3-xlarge"> 
    Blue Kitchen, Inc. became the platform for the things we learned and wish to share.
